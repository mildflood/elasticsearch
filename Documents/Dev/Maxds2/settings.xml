  <!-- mirrors
  | This is a list of mirrors to be used in downloading artifacts from remote repositories.
  |
  | It works like this: a POM may declare a repository to use in resolving certain artifacts.
  | However, this repository may have problems with heavy traffic at times, so people have mirrored
  | it to several places.
  |
  | That repository definition will have a unique id, so we can create a mirror reference for that
  | repository, to be used as an alternate download site. The mirror site will be the preferred
  | server for that repository.
  |-->
  <mirrors>
    <!-- mirror
    | Specifies a repository mirror site to use instead of a given repository. The repository that
    | this mirror serves has an ID that matches the mirrorOf element of this mirror. IDs are used
    | for inheritance and direct lookup purposes, and must be unique across the set of mirrors.

  <!-- profiles
  | This is a list of profiles which can be activated in a variety of ways, and which can modify
  | the build process. Profiles provided in the settings.xml are intended to provide local machine-
  | specific paths and repository locations which allow the build to work in the local environment.
  | NOTE: For profiles defined in the settings.xml, you are restricted to specifying only artifact
  |       repositories, plugin repositories, and free-form properties to be used as configuration
  |       variables for plugins in the POM.
  |

  <profiles>
    <!-- profile
    | Specifies a set of introductions to the build process, to be activated using one or more of the
